# Semantic Search + NER Demo

Built following the excellent [blog post by Camille Corti-Georgiou](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/articles/developing-an-elastic-search-app-with-streamlit-semantic-search-and-named-entity-extraction).

Uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependancies management, and [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the web interface.

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the app with `poetry run semantic_ner_search_demo`.
